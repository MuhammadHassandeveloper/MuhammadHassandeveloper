Your GitHub profile is already quite impressive, but here are some suggestions to make it even more professional and user-friendly:

1. **Add more visually appealing icons**: You can include icons for additional tools and technologies you use. For example, icons for **Vue.js**, **Node.js**, **React Native**, **GraphQL**, or **Kubernetes** would make it look more comprehensive.

2. **Refine the Tech Stack Section**: You can use a consistent format for your technologies. For instance, adding shields for the frameworks or languages you're most skilled in can make it more visually appealing.

3. **More Highlighted Achievements**: Include a section for your top achievements. You could add specific numbers or metrics, like "Increased website speed by 50%" or "Reduced billing errors by 30%".

4. **GitHub Activity Graph**: You might want to showcase your GitHub activity by adding a custom graph, like your contribution activity or code frequency. It can show visitors your involvement and consistent contribution.

5. **Link to Relevant Projects**: Besides your portfolio, it would be helpful to link directly to key repositories that showcase your work (like your Stripe/PayPal invoicing system). This helps visitors quickly explore your contributions.

Here’s an updated version of the profile with some improvements:
